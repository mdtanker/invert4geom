# Release process for `invert4geom`

We use _semantic versioning_, where version numbers are classified as v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.
By default, releases are made from the main branch as part of a linear release history and, as described below, are triggered by pushing a git tag to the Invert4geom repository on github.
If a patch release is required for an older version, a branch can be created from the appropriate point in main and the following instructions are still apt.

## Update the release notes:

1. Make a list of merges, contributors, and reviewers:

   ### Set release variables:

   export VERSION=<about-to-be-released version number> export
   PREVIOUS=<previous version number>

   ### Autogenerate release notes

   changelist mdtanker/invert4geom v${PREVIOUS} main --version ${VERSION}
   --config pyproject.toml --out ${VERSION}.md

   ### Put the output of the above command at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`

   cat ${VERSION}.md | cat - CHANGELOG.md > temp && mv temp CHANGELOG.md

2. Scan the PR titles for highlights and mention these in the relevant sections of the notes.
Ideally, all changed API objects are mentioned by name, e.g. a new parameter or a deprecated function.
