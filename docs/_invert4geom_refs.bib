  abstract = {In this paper the correction for the.gravitational attraction of the topography on a gravity station is considered as consistmg of two parts; (I) the restricted but conventional ``Bouguer correction'' which postulates as a convenient approximation that the topography consists of an infinite horizontal plain, and (2) the ``Terrain correction'' which is a supplementary correction taking into account the gravitational effect of the undulations of the terrain about the plane through the gravity station. The paper illustrates the necessity of making terrain corrections if precise gravity surveys are desired in hilly country and presents terrain correction tables with which this quantity may be determined to a relative accuracy of one-tenth milligal. This accuracy is required to fully utilize the high instrumental precision of modern gravimeters.},

  abstract = {Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally intensive nonlinear inverse problem. What is more, the modelling must take the Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional scale or greater. We present a regularized nonlinear gravity inversion method that has a low computational footprint and employs a spherical Earth approximation. To achieve this, we combine the highly efficient Bott's method with smoothness regularization and a discretization of the anomalous Moho into tesseroids (spherical prisms). The computational efficiency of our method is attained by harnessing the fact that all matrices involved are sparse. The inversion results are controlled by three hyperparameters: the regularization parameter, the anomalous Moho density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth. We estimate the regularization parameter using the method of hold-out cross-validation. Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the reference depth using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points. We apply the proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data. The final Moho model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and seismological data. The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is worse in the Andes and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and Patagonia, and along the Atlantic coast. Similarly to previous results, the model suggests a thinner crust of 30--35 km under the Andean foreland basins. Discrepancies with the seismological data are greatest in the Guyana Shield, the central Solimo\texttildelow es and Amazonas Basins, the Parana\textasciiacute{} Basin, and the Borborema province. These differences suggest the existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that were unaccounted for during gravity data processing.},
