```{admonition} Early-stages of development
:class: seealso

This package is at the very beginning of it's development! This means that we are still adding a lot of new features and sometimes we
make changes to the ones we already have while we try to improve the
software based on users' experience, test new ideas, take better design
decisions, etc.
Some of these changes could be **backwards incompatible**. Keep that in
mind before you update Harmonica to a newer version.
```
